# Checkers

A simple console based checkers game written in golang. 


```
You are playing as X

8 | = | O | = | O | = | O | = | O |
7 | O | = | O | = | O | = | O | = |
6 | = | O | = | O | = | O | = | O |
5 |   | = |   | = |   | = |   | = |
4 | = |   | = |   | = |   | = |   |
3 | X | = | X | = | X | = | X | = |
2 | = | X | = | X | = | X | = | X |
1 | X | = | X | = | X | = | X | = |
    A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H 

```


This is my first program with golang so there will be bugs and major room for improvement.
